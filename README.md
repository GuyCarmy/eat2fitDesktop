My final project in c# for object oriented programming project course.
Course #20586 of the open university of Israel.

Its a program for dietitions to manage the diets for their clients.
The project was wrttien using xamarin, using CosomosDB with MongoDB API.
The project is based on MVVM design pattern.
The Models: Customer, Meal, Food.
a meal holds a list of foods and time.
a customer holds personal info and 2 lists of meals (one suggested by the dietition 
and the second inserted by the customer himself, what he actually ate).

The Views for the desktop app are: main. add customer. add food. add meal.
The views for the android app are: *tbd*
